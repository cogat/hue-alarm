hue.py spawns:

* a UI for controlling the light manually
* a background process that checks a google calendar and schedules alarms

To install, test hue.py runs independently, then edit /etc/rc.local to add:

cd /home/pi/hue/
. ./env/bin/activate
screen -S hue ./hue.py


You can 'peep in' on the screen version by running
sudo screen -x hue
